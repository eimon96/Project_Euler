#The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
#    Fn = Fnâˆ’1 + Fnâˆ’2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
#Hence the first 12 terms will be:
#
#    F1 = 1
#    F2 = 1
#    F3 = 2
#    F4 = 3
#    F5 = 5
#    F6 = 8
#    F7 = 13
#    F8 = 21
#    F9 = 34
#    F10 = 55
#    F11 = 89
#    F12 = 144
#
#The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
#
#What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence 
#to contain 1000 digits?
